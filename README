This directory contains code that was used to generate SNP genotypes from koala exon capture data. 

The code is provided for archival purposes, to record the methods used in these analyses. 
 
The script snp/sh/genSNPs.sh was used to call software to map reads to the reference genome, process the resulting files, and then call variants. 

This script, genSNPs.sh, called the perl scripts: 
snp/pl/map2refs.pl
snp/pl/processBAM.pl

The illumina reads were first cleaned using a workflow that performs quality and adapter trimming, and removal of duplicate and contaminant reads (script 2-scrubReads.pl obtained from https://github.com/MVZSEQ/SCPP). The parameters used here when calling this script are recorded in clean/sh/sub_scrubreads.sh
